# Introduction

This data analytics project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte internship program (December Batch 2025).
The team provided the data through an open-source data platform, Kaggle. It contains a sales record of an e-commerce store, with key fields such as Age, Product type(fish, meat, gold, fruit, sweet, and wine), Purchasing preference, Income, expenditure, and other relevant information necessary to perform this analysis.

### Project Overview
The e-commerce store collected a well-rounded dataset of its customers to get insight into purchasing behaviour, and perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-
commerce company. By analyzing customer   and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing
strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.


## My Role
On this project, I assume the role of the data analyst to uncover these insights, provide recommendations that influence decision-making by applying K-means to create clusters and segment the customers effectively. As a Junior Data Analyst, this dataset and the requirements allowed me to learn K-means, its purpose, and syntax in R, alongside the Elbow method and IQR.

### Data Analytics Objective
- Data Cleaning and Review: Obtained dataset from Kaggle. Explore the dataset, understand its structure, and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, etc.
- Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms using K-means to segment customers based on behaviour and purchase patterns.
- Visualization
- Insights and Recommendations

Business Question:
- Which group was the biggest spender and why?
- What is the most preferred purchasing channel by expenditure and age group?
- What do each age group and segment spend the total amount?
- How much total was generated by the e-commerce store
- What were the most and least purchased items?
- Overall household income against the total amount spent
- Percentage 
- Website Traffic and Website Purchase vs Category

## Tools
- Google Sheet - Data Preview
- R Studio - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Visualization

## Data Preparation and Observation
The data was wrangled and adequately cleaned for analysis on R Studio after which the following insights were derived.


| Total Income | Average Income| Total Amount Spent  | Average Amount Spent |Median Amount Spent|Standard Deviation|
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 104,459,950  | 51687.26      | 	1,228,184          |    607.711           |     397           | 602.396          |


Analysis on each product was conducted as well to understand the sales pattern, the most sold, the least sold, and the distribution:
Result: 
| Product Type | Total Amount | Average Amount | Standard Deviation |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Fruit        | 53,283       | 26.365         | 39.78              |
| Gold         | 88,766       | 43.92          | 51.68              |
| Wine         | 61,9421      | 306.49         | 337.60             |
| Meat         | 33,5607      | 166.06         | 219.87             |
| Sweet        | 55,110       | 27.27          | 41.58              |
| Fish         | 75,997       | 37.60          | 54.89              |

### Understanding K-Means and application.

K-means, in basic terms, is a process that enables analysts to segment data into groups of clusters based on specific similarities that are crucial to understanding customer behaviour. To determine who the High, Mid, and Low spenders are based on their purchase patterns and preferences. 

- Step 1: In applying this process, I selected key fields necessary to get insight into this data. K-means clustering was performed using Household Income, Total Amount Spent, product-level spend variables, purchase channel counts, and customer age. Household Income, Age, Total Amount Spent, Products sold, etc, as seen in the syntax below:

- Step 2: After the Food Clustered Data table is created, I proceed to scale the data using the Scale() function on R. This function

The scaled data is then reviewed in a plot called the Elbow method. This Elbow method provides insight into where the cluster is applied in the syntax for what is called the centroid:
Result: 
<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (81)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb4bcef-b540-4584-a4ec-4a9779ca3928" />

From the result, the elbow section count is 3, which is the number we will be entering in the centers in the syntax below: 
Result:
<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (87)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d9ccf16-ae7b-435e-88f1-9cfe7bcbc1b3" />

I proceeded to view the size of the clusters, and the grouping clearly revealed the customers based on three segments, which were determined by their spending level and income. 
Clustred_result$size
[1] 932 531 558

After this was done, the column was created with the Column name, clusters, records, 1,2,3. Following this segmentation, the clusters were added back to the clustered data set from earlier.

After the customers were adequately segmented, I proceeded to visualize the data on R Studio using ggplot, as seen below:

<img width="803" height="472" alt="Income vs Total Spending" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a108a921-f20c-4974-a0ec-12f173e106bd" />

Other visualization syntax is seen thus: 

After this, I proceed to segment the customers by their age for even more clarity into their purchasing behaviour. The R syntax was made thus, and the final table with each segment created: 
This was the age segment from:
- 24-40 = Young Adult
- 41-53 = Middle Aged
- 54-60 = Late Career
- 61-73 = Retirement
- 74-80 = Seniors

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Business Question

- How much total was generated by the e-commerce store?
  Total Amount Generated: 1,228,184

- What is the average amount generated?
  Average: 607.711
  

- How much is the total household income?
  Total 104,459,950
  
- What is the average household income?
  Average: 51,686.962

How did each cluster perform?
| Cluster Level     | Total Spent | Average Spent | Total Income | Average Income| Balance After Purchase|Number of Customers |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| High Spenders     | 740,380      | 1394.31       | 40,248,665 | 75,798         | 39,508,285            |531                 |
| Mid Spenders      | 398,543      | 714.23        | 32,104,882 | 57,536         | 31,706,339            |558                 |
| Low Spenders      | 89,261       | 95.77         | 32,106,403 | 34,449         | 32,017,142            |932                 |


- Which age group was the biggest spender and why?

The highest spenders by age group were the Middle-Aged customers, who generated a total expenditure of 436,870 with an average spend of 532.1. This higher spending pattern is associated with their relatively higher household income and higher purchasing frequency (821 purchases), indicating stronger engagement with the platform.

The Seniors group contributed the lowest total expenditure at 32,936. Although their average spend per customer appears relatively high, this group has a very low purchasing frequency (33 purchases) and a small customer base, which significantly limits their overall contribution. Additionally, their total household income (2,154,195) is the lowest among all age groups, which likely constrains spending capacity.

  
- What is the overall purchase preference?
  
| Purchase Preference         | Total Spent    | Average Spent     |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Discounted Purchase         | 4,709          | 2.33              |
| Instore Purchase            | 11,737         | 5.81              |
| Catalogue Purchase          | 5,345          | 2.65              |
| Website Purchase            | 8,317          | 4.12              |
 

- What is the most preferred purchasing channel by each cluster level?
  Overall, each section preferred in-store purchases.
By Cluster
- Highspenders prefer in-store purchases and accumulated a total of 4,479 out of 11,737 in-store purchases. They displayed a threshold of low preference to web purchases of 2,804 of 8,317 and the lowest discounted purchases among the three segements. Compared to the three levels, the highest spenders had the highest Catalogue purchases. 
- Midspenders preferred In-store purchases compared to other purchase patterns, and the least catalogue purchases of 1,652. This level had high discount purchases of 2,080 compared to high spenders and the highest use of the web for purchases, as they accumulated a total of 3,553. 
- Lowspendes compared to the Mid and High spenders had the highest discount purchases of 2,987, and the fewest catalogue purchases and web purchases.

What is the total amount spent by each age group and segment?
- Young Adult - 214,193
- Middle Aged - 436,870
- Late Career -199,796
- Retirement - 344,389
- Seniors - 32,936

- The difference between household income and the total amount spent: 
   104459950 - 1228184 = 103,231,766


- What were the most and least purchased items?
- All product categories recorded purchases across the customer base, indicating broad product exposure. 
- Based on revenue, the most sold item is Wine. Wine was the highest purchased item among the three cluster levels(High, Mid, and Low Spenders) and also among the age groups.
- The least sold item is Sweet. This item was bought in low quantities across all cluster levels and age groups. The table below shows the total and average amount spent on each product.
  
| Product Type | Total Amount | Average Amount | Standard Deviation |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Fruit        | 53,283       | 26.365         | 39.78              |
| Gold         | 88,766       | 43.92          | 51.68              |
| Wine         | 619,421      | 306.49         | 337.60             |
| Meat         | 335,607      | 166.06         | 219.87             |
| Sweet        | 55,110       | 27.27          | 41.58              |
| Fish         | 75,997       | 37.60          | 54.89              |

### Website Traffic Vs Website Purchase
The E-commerce business should be centered around offering seamless digital services, and its most purchased or second-most-preferred purchases should be via the website. 
However, this E-commerce business falters in establishing its digital presence among the customer base, as only a few customers make purchases online. This is a downside that is evident among the Young adults who are the center of the digital age.
The relationship between website traffic and website purchases suggests potential friction in the online purchasing journey. While Middle-Aged customers recorded the highest website traffic and purchases, overall web-based purchasing remains relatively low compared to in-store transactions.
Due to the absence of time-based and session-level data, conversion efficiency cannot be conclusively determined. However, this pattern highlights an opportunity to further evaluate website usability, product placement, and checkout experience through targeted user research or surveys.

### Business Recommendation 
- Target High Spenders with premium product bundles (especially Wine and Meat) and loyalty incentives to maximize lifetime value.
- Encourage Mid Spenders to transition to higher-value purchases by promoting personalized discounts and web-exclusive offers, as they demonstrate high engagement across channels.
- Use discount-driven strategies for Low Spenders to increase purchase frequency while controlling margins.
- Improve website usability and digital experience, particularly for younger customers, to increase online purchase adoption and reduce reliance on in-store transactions.
- Conduct customer surveys to better understand channel preference drivers and optimize the omnichannel strategy.
