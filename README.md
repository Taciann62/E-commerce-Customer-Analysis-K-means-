## E-Commerce Customer Segmentation Analysis 

This project explores customer purchasing behavior for an e-commerce business using K-Means clustering to segment customers into High, Mid, and Low Spenders based on income, age, product-level spending, and purchase channel preferences.

The analysis was conducted using R, Tableau, and Google Sheets, following a complete data analytics workflow that included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, cluster optimization using the Elbow Method, and visualization. Product performance, age-based behavior, and channel preferences were examined to uncover patterns that directly impact revenue and customer engagement.

Key findings revealed that middle-aged, higher-income customers drive the majority of revenue, with Wine and Meat emerging as the highest-value products across all segments. Despite being an e-commerce platform, in-store purchases dominated, highlighting friction in the online purchasing journey and opportunities for website optimization.

The insights from this project support targeted marketing strategies, personalized promotions, loyalty programs, and digital experience improvements, demonstrating how unsupervised machine learning and data storytelling can inform real-world business decisions.
